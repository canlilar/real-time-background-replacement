# Flask + Google App Engine + Datastore

This sample demonstrates how to use [Google Cloud Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/) inside a Flask application, all running on [Google App Engine Flexible Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine).

It will create a simple Python flask app that serves some REST endpoints. The application will communicate with GCP's Datastore for a NoSQL database. The endpoints created will later be used by the Notebook 
frontend.


## Using the Cloud Shell
Head over to the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and make sure you are in the desired project.

Open the Cloud Shell by clicking this button on the top right of the console:

![img.png](../docs/img.png)

Here, you can enter commands to interact with GCP.

## App Engine and API Setup (done for you already)
**Note: We have done this step for you, so feel free to just read through it.** 

Create your App Engine application:

    gcloud app create

You will have to select a region. Choose one that is close to your location.

Next, we will enable the two GCP APIs needed to run our application. The first is the Natural Language API. The second is Datastore.

You can do all of this directly in the Cloud Shell or you setup Cloud SDK on your local machine as well (see below on how to do that)

    gcloud services enable datastore.googleapis.com

**Note: Okay, back to your part!**
You can do all of this directly in the Cloud Shell or if you setup Cloud SDK on your local machine as well (see below on how to do that)

## Cloning the code into Cloud Shell

Run the following command to clone the GitHub repository to your cloud shell (replace it with your clone/fork url):

    git clone https://github.com/canlilar/real-time-background-replacement (replace with your forked version if you want)

If you usea private repository, you will need to [log in to GitHub](../README-private-clone.md). \
Change directory to the backend directory:

    cd  "real-time-background-replacement/Live Webcam App"

## Creating a Service Account key
We are going to use the default App Engine service account to run our app. We get its key so that we can access it when 
testing the app locally.

Get the project ID and save it into an environment variable

    export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value core/project)


Get the key.json for the App Engine service account:

    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account \
    ${PROJECT_ID}@appspot.gserviceaccount.com

<span style="color:red">
<h1>
<b>
IMPORTANT: Keep this key.json a secret. You should never commit this file ever.
</b>
</h1>
</span>

## Running the backend on Cloud Shell with a Virtual Environment
To run our app through the cloud shell (that is, not deploying it just yet), we should create a virtual environment. This is just an environment where we install the specific dependencies needed by the project and can run the code.

Install virtualenv:

    pip install virtualenv

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

    virtualenv -p python3 env

If you do `ls` now, you will see an `/env` folder created which contains the virtual environment. 

Start your virtual environment:

    source env/bin/activate

Install the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Start your application via cloud shell using your virtual environment:

    python main.py

Visit the link generated ('Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/') to view your application running locally. Test it out! (click on the link from cloud shell)

You should be presented with a [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) page. This page will allow you to interact with the backend REST API easily. In the examples we have given you can make a post request where we apply sentiment analysis on some given text and then save it to [GCP Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/quickstart)
Try sending the sentence "Today is a great day for coding!" in the post request. Then execute the get request.

Press `Control-C` on your command line when you are finished to stop the application.

 
## Deactivating your virtual environment
When you are ready to leave your virtual environment:

    deactivate

## Deploying to App Engine

Deploy your application to App Engine with the following command. Please note that this may
take several minutes.

    gcloud app deploy

Visit `https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot.com` to view your deployed application.

You can continue to make new versions of the application and deploy them with the above command.

## Running Locally (Optionally)
Alternatively, if you do not wish to use the Cloud Shell you can setup the Cloud SDK on your local machine instead.
This will allow you to run the app entirely from your local machine instead of the cloud shell console.

Download the Cloud SDK here https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive

Once downloaded and installed login using:

    gcloud auth login

Link to the correct project (using the wrong project might accidently bill you instead). Extra documentation https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing

    gcloud init

For mac/linux:
    Follow the instructions above as normal. 

For Windows:
    Follow the instructions above as normal but replace `export` with `set`.
    To activate your VM, do `\venv\Scripts\activate`.

If you get an error on Windows similar to this: `running scripts is disabled on this system` then run the following command:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process

To view your application in the web browser run:

    gcloud app browse

## Deploying changes to the app
When you deploy an update, a new version of your default service is created and traffic is automatically routed to the latest version. To deploy:

From the "Live Webcam App" folder, run the following command:

    gcloud app deploy

This is the same command you used in Deploying Your Web Service.

Confirm that a new version is listed in the Google Cloud console:
